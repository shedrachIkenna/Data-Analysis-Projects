# Applestore Data Analysis

## Introduction
The primary objective of carrying out this Exploratory Data Analysis on the applestore dataset is to gain insights into the mobile apps market by exploring features such as app genres, pricing trends, user ratings and more.
By identifying relationships between variables, I was able to uncover patterns, identify outliers and uncover meaningful conclusions. This analysis is valuable to app developers as it provides insights and provides answers to questions like
* Do paid apps have higher ratings than free apps?
* Do apps with multiple language support have higher ratings?
* Is there a correlation between the lenght of app description and user ratings?
* Whats the average user ratings for each app genre?
* What are the top rated apps for each genre?
