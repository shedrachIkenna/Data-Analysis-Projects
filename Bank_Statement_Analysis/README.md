# Bank Statement Analysis

## Introduction
The central goal of conducting a Bank Account Data Analysis project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of my personal money management habits through a indepth exploration of account transactions. We'll explore things like where I spend my money, how much I keep in my account, and more. By finding links between different financial details, we'll uncover interesting patterns and unusual things that might have happened. This project is all about helping me to better understand my finances by studying my bank account data and drawing important conclusions from it.
