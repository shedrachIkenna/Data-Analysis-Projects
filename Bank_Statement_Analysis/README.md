# Bank Statement Analysis

## Introduction
The central goal of conducting a Bank Account Data Analysis project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of my personal money management habits through a indepth exploration of account transactions. We'll explore things like where I spend my money, how much I keep in my account, and more. By finding links between different financial details, we'll uncover interesting patterns and unusual things that might have happened. This project is all about helping me to better understand my finances by studying my bank account data and drawing important conclusions from it.


## Data Source
The dataset for this project is my personal bank statement which I downloaded as a PDF file from my bank's mobile app. It includes details of all my transactions between January 2023 to July 2023. Just like how Kaggle is a platform that provides datasets for data science enthusiasts, my bank statement serves as my personal dataset which we will dive into and explore for this analysis. Using this dataset also presents a perfect opportunity for showcasing my skills.
