## Glassdoor Data science Jobs Data Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the Glassdoor Data Science Job Postings Data Analysis project! In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Glassdoor's data science job postings dataset using Excel for data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization. This repository serves as a resource for exploring the project's code, data, and findings.

## About the Dataset

The Glassdoor data science job postings dataset used in this analysis provides a wealth of information about job postings related to data science roles. The dataset includes various attributes, such as job titles, company names, locations, salaries, job descriptions, and required skills.

The dataset offers a valuable snapshot of the data science job market, allowing us to gain insights into the skills and qualifications sought by employers, salary ranges, and geographical distribution of job opportunities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have analyzed the Glassdoor data science job postings dataset to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and characteristics of data science job postings. The objective was to uncover meaningful information that can inform job seekers, employers, and professionals interested in the field of data science.

## Tools and Techniques Used 

In this analysis, I leveraged the power of Excel for data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis. Excel provides a versatile and user-friendly environment to perform data manipulations and calculations, enabling us to gain a deep understanding of the dataset.

Additionally, I utilized Tableau for data visualization. Tableau offers a robust platform to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations that help uncover patterns, trends, and key insights from the data. The visualizations provide a clear and intuitive representation of the analysis findings.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this repository is to explore and analyze the Glassdoor data science jobs dataset to gain insights into the industry. Through data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to answer various questions such as:

- What are the most common job titles in the data science field?
- What are the average salaries of different data science job roles?
- What are the most in-demand skills for data science jobs?
- What are most sought after level of education required?

## Data Exploration 

The data exploration phase involved examining the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and any potential issues or inconsistencies. I used Excel to perform initial data exploration tasks, such as:
- Reviewing the dimensions and structure of the dataset.
- Identifying missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
- Assessing the distribution and summary statistics of key variables.
- Investigating relationships between variables.

## Data Cleaning 

After the initial exploration, the data cleaning process was carried out to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability. In this phase, I performed several tasks to clean and preprocess the data, including:

- Handling missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the specific context.
- Removing duplicate records to avoid redundancy.
- Standardizing formats and correcting inconsistencies in variables, such as job titles or locations.
- Transforming variables as needed to align with the analysis objectives.


## Data Analysis 

Once the data was cleaned and prepared, I proceeded with the data analysis using Excel. The analysis involved examining various aspects of the data science job postings dataset, including:

- Identifying trends and patterns in the demand for data science professionals across different industries and regions.
- Analyzing the most sought-after skills and qualifications for data science job roles.
- Investigating salary ranges and distribution for data science positions.
- Extracting insights from job descriptions to identify common keywords and requirements.


## Disclaimer

Please note that this dataset is from kaggle and hasn't been updated for past two years as of the time I executed this project. As such, the findings and insights derived from the data should be interpreted with caution due to various factors. 

I hope you find this data analysis project informative and engaging.
