## Glassdoor Data science Jobs Data Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the Glassdoor Data Science Job Postings Data Analysis project! In this project, I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of Glassdoor's data science job postings dataset using Excel for data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis, and Tableau for data visualization. This repository serves as a resource for exploring the project's code, data, and findings.

## About the Dataset

The Glassdoor data science job postings dataset used in this analysis provides a wealth of information about job postings related to data science roles. The dataset includes various attributes, such as job titles, company names, locations, salaries, job descriptions, and required skills.

The dataset offers a valuable snapshot of the data science job market, allowing us to gain insights into the skills and qualifications sought by employers, salary ranges, and geographical distribution of job opportunities.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have analyzed the Glassdoor data science job postings dataset to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and characteristics of data science job postings. The objective was to uncover meaningful information that can inform job seekers, employers, and professionals interested in the field of data science.

## Tools and Techniques Used 

In this analysis, I leveraged the power of Excel for data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis. Excel provides a versatile and user-friendly environment to perform data manipulations and calculations, enabling us to gain a deep understanding of the dataset.

Additionally, I utilized Tableau for data visualization. Tableau offers a robust platform to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations that help uncover patterns, trends, and key insights from the data. The visualizations provide a clear and intuitive representation of the analysis findings.

## Data Exploration 

The data exploration phase involved examining the dataset to understand its structure, contents, and any potential issues or inconsistencies. I used Excel to perform initial data exploration tasks, such as:
- Reviewing the dimensions and structure of the dataset.
- Identifying missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies.
- Assessing the distribution and summary statistics of key variables.
- Investigating relationships between variables.

## Data Cleaning 

After the initial exploration, the data cleaning process was carried out to ensure the dataset's quality and reliability. In this phase, I performed several tasks to clean and preprocess the data, including:

- Handling missing values by imputation or removal, depending on the specific context.
- Removing duplicate records to avoid redundancy.
- Standardizing formats and correcting inconsistencies in variables, such as job titles or locations.
- Transforming variables as needed to align with the analysis objectives.
