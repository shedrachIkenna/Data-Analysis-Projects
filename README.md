## Glassdoor Data Science Jobs Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed the Glassdoor data science job postings dataset to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and characteristics of data science job postings. The objective was to uncover meaningful information that can inform job seekers, employers, and professionals interested in the field of data science. The project is found [here](Glassdoor_Data_Science_Jobs_Analysis).
